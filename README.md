# 🚀 Emotion Detection: Love or Angry

## 📌 Overview
This project uses **Machine Learning (ML) with Logistic Regression** to classify emotions in text as **Love ❤️ or Angry 😡** based on word patterns. It utilizes **TF-IDF Vectorization** to convert text into numerical data and trains a model to make predictions.
